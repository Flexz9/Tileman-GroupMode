# Group Tileman Addon Custom Plugin 
This is only an addon to the original Tileman plugin. This is only to share tiles between players.

To export/import you have to right click the world map icon, right bottom corner of the minimap. This will interact with your clipboard directly.

# Tileman Mode Custom Plugin 
Tileman Mode is a series on youtube, check out the playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLNTajexsGYaw5pcyLOMyrW6w8_IMDG90">here</a>.

The game mode is defined by the player being limited to standing on certain tiles. The amount of tiles you are allowed to stand on depends on your total experience. Each 1000 exp represents one tile you can 'spend'. 

This plugin sets out to make the marking of tiles and the counting of both your used and remaining tiles automated.
